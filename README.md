# DuplicateImageFinder

search = dif(sourceFolder, move_to=destinationFolder, show_output=True, delete=True, )

using this piece of code I found from the difPy library, I have created this code which allows you to find duplicate images in a given folder. Normally, the code does not require there to be a variable for source and destination folders. However, to make it more user friendly, I have decided to add these variables so that any person who runs the code can do it easily without the need for a knowledge in coding. I also decided to use the show output command for the images to be deleted so that they can be sure that nothing of importance is deleted.
